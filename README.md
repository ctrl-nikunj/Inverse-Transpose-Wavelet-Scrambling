# Inverse Transpose Wavelet Scrambling

A novel image scrambling technique designed for steganography applications, aiming to balance security and visual imperceptibility in stego images.

## 🧠 Overview

This MATLAB-based project introduces a scrambling method that combines inverse operations, matrix transposition, and wavelet transformations. The goal is to enhance the security of hidden messages within images while maintaining the original image's visual quality.

## 🔍 Features

- **Inverse Transformation**: Applies inverse operations to disrupt pixel arrangements.
- **Matrix Transposition**: Alters image structure to increase entropy.
- **Wavelet Transformation**: Utilizes wavelet decomposition to scramble frequency components.
- **Steganography Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with steganographic embedding techniques.
